# Intro
I was born and raised in Mayaguez, Puerto Rico. As a high schooler, I was involved in 5 sports, loved math, and was the president of my senior class. I also took up acting, something I also pursued in college and was a frequent dance participant in our class talent shows.

After high school, I attended M.I.T. where I did undergraduate research in the MIT Space Systems Lab, the Sloan School of Management, and the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. I had the opportunity to explore a variety of academic interests (switching majors 3 times) and ended up majoring in Computer Science while also receiving a degree from the Sloan School and concentrating in economics, math, and philosophy. I developed a strong interest in programming and software engineering after numerous data-science-focused internships convinced me the lack of adequate software systems was the main contributor many companies' inability to leverage their data effectively.  

I'm interested in travel, entrepreneurship, different performing arts such as improv and acting, fitness, and mental health research. I'm a software engineer specializing in machine learning and full-stack development. I am most interested in ML Platforms and have a keen interest in autonomous systems at the moment.
