<!-- # Intro
I was born and raised in Mayaguez, Puerto Rico. As a high schooler, I was involved in 5 sports, loved math, and was the president of my senior class. I was a frequent dance participant in our class talent shows.

After high school, I attended M.I.T. where I did undergraduate research in the MIT Space Systems Lab, the Sloan School of Management, and the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. I had the opportunity to explore a variety of academic interests (switching majors 3 times) and ended up majoring in Computer Science while also receiving a degree from the Sloan School, concentrating in economics, and taking additional significant coursework in math and philosophy.  

I've been a machine learning and data engineer and have now transitioned into product management, where I'm most interested in Web3 and AI products. I am enthused about how far we've come and excited about the road ahead as we build a fairer and more decentralized web and as we bridge the gap between human and machine intelligence. I've had great success building AI and Analytics products to solve a diverse array of business and societal problems and have started work on very exciting web3.0 projects.

Outside of work he enjoys many latin dances, international traveling, exploring new cuisines, obstacle racing, athletics, and podcasts and lectures / presentations through spotify and youtube. -->
