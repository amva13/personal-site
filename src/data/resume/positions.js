      'Collaborated with Product Managers and Engineering Managers in the Growth team in order to develop experimentation tooling mining online A/B experiments of greatest impact to key product metrics. A 5x reduction in time to resolution of login incidents was realized, totaling over $300K in annual engineering hours.',
      'Researched an A/B experiment metrics validation framework. Collaborated with Data Scientists in order to implement the framework and protect the experimentation platform from systemic risks. 5 concerning metrics were identified.',
      'Collaborated with Product Managers, my tech lead, an apprentice engineer, and engineers in order to define metrics quality goals and design and implement a data validation and alerting platform for the company. Additionally, I led the assessing and learning effort after launch by leading user feedback sessions, iterating, and proposing expansions to the existing design. The platform helped save the company close to 2 million dollars in engineering hours.',
